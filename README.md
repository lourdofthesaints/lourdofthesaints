<h1>Cyber Security Student</h1>
:wave: Hi, I’m <strong>Lourdes De Los Santos</strong>
 I am interested in cyber security and catching scammers :ninja:.
 I’m currently learning with google learning and obtaining my certificates.
 I am looking to collaborate on any projects involving cyber security.
 you can reach me at :mailbox: <font color="red"> Lourdesd90delossantos@gmail.com.</font>
 Fun fact: :paintbrush: I can paint and draw and was even experimenting with digital art before I became interested in cyber security.
